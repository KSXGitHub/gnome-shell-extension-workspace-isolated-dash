Isolate workspaces in Gnome Shell, so the Dash does not show application icons of apps not on the current workspace, unless they are favourited.
Additionally, activating an application will open a new window if no existing windows are on the current workspace.

Original idea from: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/876/isolated-workspaces/ and https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/440/workspace-separation-on-dash/

The previous approaches reimplemented many parts, causing incompatibilities and large codebases. This implementation is significantly smaller and easier to maintain as it does not reimplement half the Dash to achieve the same features. It also fixes a number of bugs, as well as adding new features. For example, application icons are also updated.
